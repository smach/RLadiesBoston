# Tips and Tricks for Tables in R
## R Ladies Boston presentation January 12, 2021

Check out the presentation slides file _interactiveTablesRLadiesBoston.Rmd_ made with the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/) package. 

The demonstration tables use the DT, reactable, and sparkline R packages, as well as dplyr, rio, glue, htmltools, and htmlwidgets. Plus the icon package for the title slide. _packages.R_ in the R directory will load all those (and uses the pacman package to install them if they're not already on your system.)

Data files used in the demo are in the data directory (plus a few additional data files I thought I might use but never removed.)
