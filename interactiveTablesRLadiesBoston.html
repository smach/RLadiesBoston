### DT

### reactable

---
#### Get latest Covid data by state:


```r
library(dplyr)
state_data &lt;- rio::import("data/latest_covid_by_state.csv") %&gt;%
  select(state, newCasesPer100K = metrics.caseDensity, testPositivity = metrics.testPositivityRatio, lastUpdatedDate) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    newCasesPer100K = round(newCasesPer100K, 1),
    testPositivity = round(testPositivity, 3)
  ) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(newCasesPer100K))
```

## DT default [https://rstudio.github.io/DT/](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)


```r
DT::datatable(state_data, options = list(pageLength = 6))

## DT advantages (cont)

- Built-in filters sensitive to data type - major advantage over reactable
- Better defaults (although reactable easily customized)
- Easy to enable search by regular expression
- Numerous extensions and plug-ins for things like buttons to download data

```r
library(DT)
datatable(state_data,  filter = 'top', extensions = 'Buttons', 
options = list(pageLength = 6, dom = 'Bfrtip', 
          buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf', 'print')) )
